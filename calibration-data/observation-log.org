* Beehive Sensor Calibration Observation Log

** Hot Cup Insulated

   I placed a hot cup into the box and blew the fan.

   Once the temperature peaked I removed the cup, and turned off the
   fan.

   Then a mishap happened, and I lost all the data leading up to this
   event - but the data I want to calibrate is the one available.

   The TESTO-values were 97.4%, 24.0C when the chamber was opened at
   the end.


** Hot Bottle Insulated

   As expected, humidity dropped due to the increasing dry
   temperature.

   At 21:43 CEST I removed the bottle and turned off the fan.

   AT 23:05 CEST the temperature was still quite divergent (between 24C and 24.8C).

   I then opened the box and pressed the measure-button on the TESTO device:

   24C, 88.1%
