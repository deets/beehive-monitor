* Beehive Sensor Calibration Observation Log

** Hot Cup Insulated

   I placed a hot cup into the box and blew the fan.

   Once the temperature peaked I removed the cup, and turned off the
   fan.

   Then a mishap happened, and I lost all the data leading up to this
   event - but the data I want to calibrate is the one available.

   The TESTO-values were 97.4%, 24.0C when the chamber was opened at
   the end.
